###Problem 4.1
**Repeat Example 4.1, but using the function for f(t) = A for $0 \leq t \leq w$ and and f(t) = 0 for all other values of t. Explain the reason for any differences between your results and the results in the example.**




\\[
    F(\mu) = \int_{\infty}^{-\infty} f(t)e^{-j2\pi\mu t} dt
    \\= \int_{0}^{W} Ae^{-j2\pi\mu t} dt
    \\= \frac{-A}{2\pi\mu j} * e^{-j2\pi\mu t} \Big|_0^W \
    \\= \frac{-A}{2\pi\mu j} * [e^{-j2\pi\mu W}- 1]
    \\= \frac{-A}{2\pi\mu j} * [e^{-j\pi\mu W} + e^{-j\pi\mu W}] * e^{-j\pi\mu W}
    \\= \frac{A}{\pi\mu} * sin(\pi \mu t)
    \\= AW\frac{sin(\pi \mu t)}{\pi \mu t} * e^{-j\pi\mu W}
\\]

If we compare the above result with the result in example 4.1, we can find that they are very similar except here we have a extra phase term. The phase only represents how much the function is shifted. The magnitude of the function are the same in both cases


###Problem 4.2
**Show that F(u) in Eq.(4.4-2) is infinitely periodic in both directions, with period 1/$\Delta$T.**
###Problem 4.7
**As the figure below shows, the Fourier transform of a “tent” function (on the left) is a squared sinc function (on the right). Advance an argument that shows that the Fourier transform of a tent function can be obtained from the Fourier transform of a box function. (Hint: The tent itself can be generated by convolving two equal boxes.)**
###Problem 4.12
**Consider a checkerboard image in which each square is 1 * 1 mm. Assuming that the image extends infinitely in both coordinate directions, what is the mini- mum sampling rate (in samples/mm) required to avoid aliasing?**
###Problem 4.13
**We know from the discussion in Section 4.5.4 that shrinking an image can cause aliasing. Is this true also of zooming? Explain.**
###Problem 4.15
**You are given a “canned” program that computes the 2-D, DFT pair. However, it is not known in which of the two equations the $1/MN$ term is included or if it was split as two constants $1/\sqrt{MN}$ in front of both the forward and inverse transforms. How can you find where the term(s) is (are) included if this information is not available in the documentation?**
###Problem 4.21
**The need for image padding when filtering in the frequency domain was dis- cussed in Section 4.6.6. We showed in that section that images needed to be padded by appending zeros to the ends of rows and columns in the image (see the following image on the left). Do you think it would make a difference if we centered the image and surrounded it by a border of zeros instead (see image on the right), but without changing the total number of zeros used? Explain.**
###Problem 4.23
**You know from Table 4.2 that the dc term, F(0, 0), of a DFT is proportional to the average value of its corresponding spatial image. Assume that the image is of size M * N. Suppose that you pad the image with zeros to size P * Q, where P and Q are given in Eqs. (4.6-31) and (4.6-32). Let $F_p (0, 0)$ denote the dc term of the DFT of the padded function. 
(a) What is the ratio of the average values of the original and padded images? 
(b) Is $F_p(0, 0) = F(0, 0)$? Support your answer mathematically.**
